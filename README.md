## Notes

I tried to break the features down and list how they were handled by various pieces of the architecture.

### Date
March 29th, 2022

### Time spent
How much time did you spend on the assignment? Normally, this is expressed in hours.
About 2 hours on the architecture diagram. About 8 hours on the coding. 

### Assumptions made
I assumed vendors and how they setup auctions is out of scope. I assumed each business unit will have their own realtime database which allows for white labelling the app. 

### Shortcuts/Compromises made
None.

### Stretch goals attempted
If applicable, use this area to tell us what stretch goals you attempted. What went well? What do you wish
you could have done better? If you didn&#39;t attempt any of the stretch goals, feel free to let us know why.

I attempted to solve all the stretch goals and have outlined how I would approach them in the document. 

### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?
Were you short on time and not able to include something that you want us to know
about? Please list it here so that we know that you considered it.
I misread the assignment and actually coded a solution: https://github.com/rockarts/Auctions

### Other information about your submission that you feel it&#39;s important that we know if
applicable.
I would love the chance to speak about it!

### Your feedback on this technical challenge
Have feedback for how we could make this assignment better? Please let us know.
It was a fun project. Maybe put in big bold letters at the top that no code is expected, I wanted to make an impression and got excited about writing code and didn't realize it wasn't a take home coding test.
